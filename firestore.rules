/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model
 * with three primary roles: Customer, Stylist, and Admin. Admins have broad
 * permissions across the system, while Customers and Stylists have strict
 * ownership-based access to their personal data and appointments. The existence of a
 * document in the `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection grants a user admin privileges.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is segregated by role and ownership. Customer and
 * Stylist data, including their respective views of appointments, are stored in
 * user-specific paths (e.g., `/customers/{userId}`). A separate, denormalized
 * collection, `/admin_appointments`, provides a centralized view for the admin
 * dashboard. Publicly accessible data like salon services is stored in a top-level
 * `/services` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role: A user is considered an admin if a document with their UID exists
 *   in the `/roles_admin` collection. This provides a simple and secure way to
 *   manage elevated privileges.
 * - User Data Isolation: Customers and Stylists are strictly confined to their
 *   own data trees. Users cannot list or view profiles of other users (except for
 *   stylist profiles, which are public to signed-in users).
 * - Denormalization for Security: Appointment data is denormalized into three
 *   separate locations (`/customers/...`, `/stylists/...`, `/admin_appointments/...`) to
 *   ensure that security rules for each role are simple, performant, and do not
 *   require slow, cross-collection `get()` calls.
 * - Public vs. Private: Public data (like `/services`) is explicitly marked as
 *   readable by anyone. All other collections require authentication, and most
 *   require specific ownership or admin rights.
