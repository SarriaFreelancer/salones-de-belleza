/**
 * @file firestore.rules
 * @description Security rules for the Divas AyA Salon application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a security model based on a combination of user roles and document ownership.
 * There are three primary roles defined in the User document's 'userType' field: 'admin', 'stylist', and 'customer'.
 * - Admins have broad read access and are the only users who can manage public-facing content like Services and Gallery images.
 * - Customers have full control over their own user profile and their appointments.
 * - Stylists have read and update access to appointments they are assigned to.
 * The default posture is to deny access, granting permissions explicitly and securely.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores all user profiles (admins, stylists, customers).
 * - /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: A user-specific subcollection for appointments, enforcing ownership via the document path.
 * - /services/{serviceId}: A top-level collection for salon services, intended for public read access.
 * - /gallery/{galleryId}: A top-level collection for gallery images, also for public read access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration is Disallowed: Listing the top-level `/users` collection is forbidden to protect user privacy.
 * - Admin-Only Writes for Public Data: Only users with the 'admin' role can create, update, or delete documents in the `/services` and `/gallery` collections. This is verified by reading the user's own profile document.
 * - Strict Ownership for Private Data: A user can only access the data tree under their own user ID (e.g., `/users/{userId}/*`).
 * - Shared Access for Appointments: While appointments are owned by the customer who booked them, read and update access is also granted to the specific stylist assigned to that appointment via the `stylistId` field.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset relies on the `userType` field being present on each user's document in the `/users` collection. This allows for an efficient role check (`isAdmin()`) with a single `get()` call, which is necessary for managing global collections like `/services` and `/gallery`. The `stylistId` is denormalized onto each `Appointment` document, enabling a simple and fast authorization check for stylists without extra database reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Private user data (appointments) is stored in a user-owned subcollection (`/users/{userId}/appointments`). This is more secure and performant than mixing it in a top-level collection, as it allows for simple, path-based ownership rules for listing and access. Public data (`services`, `gallery`) is kept in separate top-level collections.
